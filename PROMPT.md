Pomodoro Timer React, NextJS
[[_TOC_]]
# Guidance on how to initialize and build my project

**Prompt Used:**

I requested guidance for building a Pomodoro Timer (Tomato Clock) using React, TypeScript, and Chakra UI with the following specifications:

- Timer Display
- Start/Pause, Reset button
- Automatic Break
- Cycle Counter
- Using React, NextJS, TypeScript and Chakra UI as the technical stack.

**Response:**

I was provided comprehensive guidance on how to initialise and build my project, in a step-by-step format. Steps included initialising the project, creating the Timer component, implementing timer logic, and adding buttons to control the timer.



# Switch between the 'Work' and 'Break' cycles of the timer

**Prompt Used:**

*"To implement the Automatic Break feature, where after the 25-minute work timer completes, a 5-minute break timer should automatically start with a clear indication to the user of the mode (work or break), I asked ChatGPT for a solution to this requirement."*

**Response:**

The response provided a well-structured solution which uses a conditional (ternary) operator to switch between the 'Work' and 'Break' cycles of the timer. The timer checks if the current cycle is 'Work', and if so, it starts the 'Break' cycle when the timer reaches 0. Otherwise, it starts the 'Work' cycle.



# Fix break timer doesn't start automatically

**Prompt Used:**

"After implementing the timer, I noticed that the 5-minute break timer doesn't start automatically after the 25-minute work timer completes and realised I need to adjust this. Therefore, I asked ChatGPT for a solution to this issue."

**Response:**

ChatGPT provided an updated solution to start the break timer automatically after the work timer ends. The adjustment was made in the setState call that runs when minutes and seconds are both at 0. It was recommended to set isRunning to true, so that the new cycle starts immediately:

```
if (minutes === 0 && seconds === 0) {

 clearInterval(interval);

 setState(s => ({

  ...s,

  isRunning: true, // <- This now starts the new work or break timer automatically

  cycle: s.cycle === 'Work' ? 'Break' : 'Work',

  minutes: s.cycle === 'Work' ? 5 : 25,

 }));

}
```
This update ensures that the break timer starts immediately after the work timer completes, and also switches back to the work timer likewise.

This response provided a concise and effective solution to implement the functionality needed, while maintaining user-friendliness of the application.

# Implementing the Cycle Counter

**Prompt Used:**

"I needed to display the number of complete work/break cycles in the timer. Therefore, I prompted ChatGPT to provide a solution for implementing a cycle counter."

**Response:**

ChatGPT offered a solution to implement a cycle counter by adding a new state variable cycleCount. This variable is incremented every time a 'work' cycle completes.



# Comparing LocalStorage and Zustand for State Management

**Prompt Used:**

"I was considering the use of localStorage or zustand for state management in my application. I asked ChatGPT to compare these options based on the application requirements, sharing the pros and cons for each to determine the most suitable choice."

**Response:**

ChatGPT briefly explained the pros and cons of both localStorage and zustand.

Based on the explanation, for a simple cycle counter scenario where persistence is required, localStorage is a straightforward solution. However, if there are plans for a complex or large state to manage in the future, or if exploring more advanced features is desirable, Zustand would be a good tool to learn and use.





# Implementing Cycle Count Storage using LocalStorage

**Prompt Used:**

"I am considering using localStorage to store the cycle count in the browser for a single user usage scenario. I asked ChatGPT for an updated version of the code using localStorage."

**Response:**

ChatGPT provided code to implement cycle count storage using localStorage.

The function getCycleCount was created to retrieve the cycle count from localStorag

A check was added to ensure that localStorage is only accessed when running in the browser where window is defined.

The response correctly provides a way to implement cycle count storage using localStorage, ensuring correct function even with server-side rendering. The note to avoid storing sensitive or confidential information in localStorage is very important from a security perspective.



# Resolving React Hydration Error - "Text content did not match"

**Prompt Used:**

"During the development of my timer application, I encountered a React hydration error stating 'Text content did not match. Server: 0 Client: 18'. I asked ChatGPT why this error was present and how to fix it."

**Response:**

ChatGPT explained that this warning message is due to a mismatch between server-side rendered content and the client-side content during hydration. It usually occurs in Next.js when using data from localStorage or client-side only APIs inside components. These APIs are not available on the server.

The warning arose because during the first render (done on the server), the cycleCount was 0 since the window object isn't available on the server. But when hydration happened on the client side, we updated cycleCount based on the value in localStorage. React was alerting us about this discrepancy.

The provided solution was to delay the hydration of the component until we're ready. This can be achieved by using a state to hold the cycleCount and initializing it on componentDidMount for class components or useEffect for functional components as follows



Setting Up Jest for Component Testing

**Prompt Used:**

"I asked ChatGPT to guide me on how to use Jest to test all the React components in my application."

**Response:**

ChatGPT provided instructions for setting up Jest for testing React components.



I use it to write test for different components, convert them to use typestcript.





# Centering Content Vertically and Horizontally with Chakra UI

**Prompt Used:**

"I asked ChatGPT to guide me on how to center content both vertically and horizontally using Chakra UI."

**Response:**

ChatGPT provided a step-by-step instruction on how to use Chakra UI to center content both vertically and horizontally.

The recommended approach was to use the alignItems and justifyContent CSS properties with the value 'center' on a container component.

This could be achieved in Chakra UI by passing these properties directly as props to any Chakra UI component.

Hereâ€™s the step-by-step code snippet provided by ChatGPT:

```
import { Box } from "@chakra-ui/react";

export function CenteredComponent() {

 return (

  <Box display="flex" justifyContent="center" alignItems="center" height="100vh">

   <Box>Your content goes here</Box>

  </Box>

 );

}
```
In this code snippet:

- display="flex" turns the Box into a flex container.
- justifyContent="center" horizontally centers the child components,
- alignItems="center" vertically centers them.
- height="100vh" is used to ensure that the Box covers the entire height of the viewport, helping the content become absolutely centered
